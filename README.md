### üéØ About

This project is a comprehensive blogging platform designed to provide a modern and efficient solution for content creators. The primary motivation behind building Œõog was to create a full-stack application that leverages the power of Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation, combined with the real-time capabilities of Firebase for authentication and database management.

The target users for this platform are writers, developers, and content creators who are looking for a simple, yet powerful, tool to publish their work. What makes this project unique is its seamless integration of the **Blocknote** rich text editor, which offers a Notion-like editing experience with support for various block types, including markdown shortcuts and real-time collaboration. The custom HTML renderer ensures that the content is displayed beautifully and consistently across all devices.
